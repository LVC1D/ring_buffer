# Week 10 Personal Reflections

1. Integration Challenge

Definitely the design articulation and the independent sketching / layout of the code felt a little overwhelming, especially at the beginning (not as used to making my own decisions in the field that still feels a little new - despite my progress through focused material so far)

2. Design vs Implementation Gap

Not as much the building of SOME individual blocks- but thinking about building the bridge between them - as in how to make them communicate with each other in the way that the at-first-seemingly-vague criteria requirement s / briefs (i..e: turning the RingBuffer into async with channels and implementing the send / recv / Future traits for it all

3. Productive Struggle Insight

After like 4th or 5th attempt to try debug and fix the hanging of the proptest or the multi-threaded contention one - I realize that after a few attempts that are done TOGETHER with you - both not really understanding what is going on why exactly - I know that's the time to hit the brakes full-on and just either note that down ,move on OR (if you could at your own discretion - perform external research online (Reddit/ Github repos, recent blog material etc) for extra help, not just internal trained database of your own, or just verified website resources

4. What Clicked vs What's Still Fuzzy

The Future implementation and the channel structure - much more crystal clear now with this example 9I think I proved that with the replication test); but if I were to be asked to re-build the entire Week 10 project + all the tests and benches - eehh, that would tale much more time and energy from me to try re-figure it all out

5. Well, let's see - it will be WASM material if I'm not mistaken - soo... I don't know what even should be carried forward in there... depends on how that material will be delivered to me
